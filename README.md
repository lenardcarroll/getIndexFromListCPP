# getIndexFromListCPP
I'm learning C++, so here is a basic set of files to help find the index of an element in a list in C++.

The file Shortcut.cpp contains three functions. These functions help to find the index of an element in a list of integers, floating point numbers or strings. The index number is then returned (which you could store). In main.cpp, an example is shown, as well as a confirmation check.
